# DataHarvest

 "数据收割者" - 强调从网络采集数据并储存，如收获季节般汇集信息。

## Usage

### Adjust the template to your needs

- Use this repo [as a template](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template).
- Replace all occurrences of "DataHarvest" in the relevant CMakeLists.txt with the name of your project
  - Capitalization matters here: `DataHarvest` means the name of the project, while `dataharvest` is used in file names.
  - Remember to rename the `include/dataharvest` directory to use your project's lowercase name and update all relevant `#include`s accordingly.
- Replace the source files with your own
- For header-only libraries: see the comments in [CMakeLists.txt](CMakeLists.txt)
- Add [your project's codecov token](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/quick-start) to your project's github secrets under `CODECOV_TOKEN`
- Happy coding!

Eventually, you can remove any unused files, such as the standalone directory or irrelevant github workflows for your project.
Feel free to replace the License with one suited for your project.

To cleanly separate the library and subproject code, the outer `CMakeList.txt` only defines the library itself while the tests and other subprojects are self-contained in their own directories. 
During development it is usually convenient to [build all subprojects at once](#build-everything-at-once).

### Build and run the standalone target

Use the following command to build and run the executable target.

```bash
cmake -S standalone -B build/standalone
cmake --build build/standalone
./build/standalone/DataHarvest --help
```

### Build and run test suite

Use the following commands from the project's root directory to run the test suite.

```bash
cmake -S test -B build/test
cmake --build build/test
CTEST_OUTPUT_ON_FAILURE=1 cmake --build build/test --target test

# or simply call the executable: 
./build/test/DataHarvestTests
```

To collect code coverage information, run CMake with the `-DENABLE_TEST_COVERAGE=1` option.

### Run clang-format

Use the following commands from the project's root directory to check and fix C++ and CMake source style.
This requires _clang-format_, _cmake-format_ and _pyyaml_ to be installed on the current system.

```bash
cmake -S test -B build/test

# view changes
cmake --build build/test --target format

# apply changes
cmake --build build/test --target fix-format
```

See [Format.cmake](https://github.com/Riiy/Format.cmake) for details.
These dependencies can be easily installed using pip.

```bash
pip install clang-format==14.0.6 cmake_format==0.6.11 pyyaml
```

### Build the documentation

The documentation is automatically built and [published](https://riiy.github.io/DataHarvest) whenever a [GitHub Release](https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-releases-in-a-repository) is created.
To manually build documentation, call the following command.

```bash
cmake -S documentation -B build/doc
cmake --build build/doc --target GenerateDocs
# view the docs
open build/doc/doxygen/html/index.html
```

To build the documentation locally, you will need Doxygen, jinja2 and Pygments installed on your system.

### Build everything at once

The project also includes an `all` directory that allows building all targets at the same time.
This is useful during development, as it exposes all subprojects to your IDE and avoids redundant builds of the library.

```bash
cmake -S all -B build
cmake --build build

# run tests
./build/test/DataHarvestTests
# format code
cmake --build build --target fix-format
# run standalone
./build/standalone/DataHarvest --help
# build docs
cmake --build build --target GenerateDocs
```

### Additional tools

The test and standalone subprojects include the [tools.cmake](cmake/tools.cmake) file which is used to import additional tools on-demand through CMake configuration arguments.
The following are currently supported.

#### Sanitizers

Sanitizers can be enabled by configuring CMake with `-DUSE_SANITIZER=<Address | Memory | MemoryWithOrigins | Undefined | Thread | Leak | 'Address;Undefined'>`.

#### Static Analyzers

Static Analyzers can be enabled by setting `-DUSE_STATIC_ANALYZER=<clang-tidy | iwyu | cppcheck>`, or a combination of those in quotation marks, separated by semicolons.
By default, analyzers will automatically find configuration files such as `.clang-format`.
Additional arguments can be passed to the analyzers by setting the `CLANG_TIDY_ARGS`, `IWYU_ARGS` or `CPPCHECK_ARGS` variables.

#### Ccache

Ccache can be enabled by configuring with `-DUSE_CCACHE=<ON | OFF>`.
